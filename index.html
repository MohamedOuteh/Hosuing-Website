      <h2>The story</h2>
      <p>
        This is a story ablut how two people had an idea that would change their lives forever. Clive and Tyrone were thinking one day about starting their own business
        that would help get them out their bad neighborhood. They started working and saving up money to buy their first property, renevate it and sell it off at the best price
        possible. They sold their first property for Â£300,000 which was just the start of the dominoe. They started buying more and selling more property every year and grew
        bigger and bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the business that they own sell houses to A class clients with the fairest prices and they got themselves out of the hood and never looked back.
